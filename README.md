Minimal Viable Product (MVP) for Simple Calculator Compiler:

1.Architecture:

Description:
-Lexer:Tokenizes input expressions and passes tokens to the parser.
- Parser:Parses expressions, builds an abstract syntax tree (AST), and passes it to the evaluator.
-Evaluator:Computes the result based on the AST and displays it to the user.
-User Interface:Takes input expressions, displays them, and shows the computed result.

2. APIs and Methods:
Web Server to Client Communication:
- API Routes:
  - /evaluate: POST request to submit an arithmetic expression for evaluation.

Client to Server Communication (Not applicable in this MVP)

3rd Party APIs:
- None (Not applicable in this MVP)



3. Data Model:


Description:
- Data model includes an `Expression` entity with attributes for the input expression and the computed result.

4. User Stories:
1.As a user, I want to input a basic arithmetic expression to get the computed result.
  - Acceptance Criteria:The system should evaluate expressions like "2 + 3" and display the result as "5".
2. As a user, I want to see an error message for invalid expressions.
   - Acceptance Criteria:If the user inputs "2 ++ 3," the system should display a clear error message.
3. As a user, I want to use parentheses to group expressions.
   - Acceptance Criteria:The system should correctly handle expressions like "2 * (3 + 4)" and display the result as "14".

5. Mockups:
Calculator Input View:


Calculator Result View:


Description:
- The input view allows users to enter expressions, and the result view displays the computed result.

This MVP provides a clear architectural overview, defines communication protocols, outlines the data model, establishes user stories, and presents mockups for the Simple Calculator Compiler. The project can evolve with additional features based on user feedback and requirements.
